# Krator Assistant Framework

Krator is a modular AI assistant framework. The project is
structured as a Python package with pluggable modules for presence detection,
voice control, project management and automation. The framework targets
Raspberry Pi and desktop systems.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

The assistant will listen for commands from the microphone or the terminal and
respond with simple status messages.
