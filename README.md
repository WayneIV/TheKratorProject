TheKratorProject
Cybersecurity Intelligence for the Next Era

The Krator Project is an advanced cybersecurity research lab focused on building high-impact tools, intelligent defenses, and experimental technologies for securing the digital world. From threat discovery to AI-powered countermeasures, our mission is to push the boundaries of what’s possible in cyber intelligence and defense.

## Krator GUI

The repository includes a minimal Tkinter-based GUI (`krator_gui.py`) as a placeholder interface for future tools. The GUI features a green-on-black style and buttons for planned components such as GeoLocation, IP/Port, Web Scraping, OSINT, Password Cracking (unimplemented) and Bug Bounty utilities.

## Remote Assistant

The project now includes `assistant.py`, a command-line helper for managing remote Linux hosts over SSH. It uses the open-source Paramiko library and supports running individual commands or entering an interactive shell.

### Usage

Install dependencies first:

```bash
pip install paramiko
```

Run a single command remotely:

```bash
python assistant.py <host> <user> "<command>"
```

Or start an interactive session:

```bash
python assistant.py <host> <user>
```

The assistant will prompt for your SSH password if it isn't provided with `--password`.


## Vision Assistant

`vision_assistant.py` adds basic computer vision capabilities using OpenCV and Tesseract. It can:

- Detect faces, eyes and human bodies via Haar cascades
- Extract text from images with OCR
- Calculate simple scene metrics such as brightness

Run it against an image file:

```bash
python vision_assistant.py path/to/image.jpg
```

The tool outputs detected objects and a brief, slightly skeptical analysis of any extracted text.
