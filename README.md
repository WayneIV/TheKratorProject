# TheKratorProject

**Cybersecurity Intelligence for the Next Era**

The Krator Project is an open source collection of security and AI utilities.  It began as an advanced research effort and now provides simple tools that anyone can experiment with.  Each module can be run on its own and requires only a basic Python setup.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Python 3.8+** if it is not already available.
2. **Clone this repository** and install the requirements:

   ```bash
   git clone <this repo>
   cd TheKratorProject
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Launch the sample GUI** to explore planned components:

   ```bash
   python krator_gui.py
   ```

These steps should work on any desktop operating system with Python installed.




‚öîÔ∏è KRATOROPS (Offense Division)
Red teaming, exploitation, and lateral movement tools.

üß∑ KRATORSHIELD (Defense Division)
Cyber awareness apps, honeypots, and real-time endpoint defense.

üß¨ KRATORLABS (Innovation Lab)
R&D streams: AI-driven threat profiling, zero-day sim sandboxing, and quantum resilience.

üíº KRATORCONSOLE (Web UI / SaaS Portal)
Optional control panel with dashboards, team management, and integrated reporting

üîß Tech Stack
Languages: Python ¬∑ Rust ¬∑ JavaScript

UI Framework: React + Tailwind CSS

Infra & DevOps: GitHub Actions ¬∑ Docker (optional) ¬∑ CLI-first design


## Krator GUI

`krator_gui.py` provides a small desktop window that shows where future features will live.  Run it with:

```bash
python krator_gui.py
```

You will see green buttons for geolocation, OSINT and other categories.  They are only placeholders today but demonstrate the style of the interface.

## Remote Assistant

`assistant.py` lets you run commands on another Linux machine over SSH.  After installing the `paramiko` package (already listed in `requirements.txt`), use it like this:

```bash
python assistant.py <host> <username> "<command>"
```

Omit the command to drop into an interactive shell:

```bash
python assistant.py <host> <username>
```

You will be asked for your SSH password unless you specify `--password` on the command line.


## Vision Assistant

`vision_assistant.py` offers simple computer vision utilities using OpenCV and Tesseract.  It can:

- Detect faces, eyes and human bodies via Haar cascades
- Extract text from images with OCR
- Calculate simple scene metrics such as brightness

Run it against an image file:

```bash
python vision_assistant.py path/to/image.jpg
```

The tool outputs detected objects and a brief, slightly skeptical analysis of any extracted text.

## Krator Assistant Skeleton

The remainder of the repository is a small framework for building a multi-device assistant named **Krator**.  The modules are minimal but demonstrate how features could be connected.  Key files include:

- `krator_core.py` ‚Äì central orchestrator
- `presence_detector.py` ‚Äì detects when the user is nearby
- `project_manager.py` ‚Äì placeholder for task integrations
- `vision_module.py` ‚Äì simple camera handling
- `voice_interface.py` ‚Äì speech input and output
- `task_router.py` ‚Äì routes natural language commands
- `device_bridge.py` ‚Äì sends commands between devices
- `security_layer.py` ‚Äì stubs for authentication

These files are only skeletons but form the foundation for future development of Krator's assistant capabilities.
